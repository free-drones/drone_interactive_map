The concept is developed by Andreas Gising as an attempt to go straight from consumption of collected information to control of a system of systems.
The implementation is mainly done by very intelligent and ambitious students from Link√∂ping University. Through the PUM course ( ProgramUtvecklingsMetodik), a course where the students meet realistic challanges and customer relations, student groups have run a development project with RISE as customer.
One group of 7 started in 2020, see [their report here](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1444831).
Another group of 10 started in 2023, their work is ongoing.

Main contributors from RISE are, Andreas Gising, Lennart Ochel, Rasmus Lunqvist and Kristoffer Bergman.
